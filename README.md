# SOS-wfh-Team-5: ReConnect

Team members who worked on this include:
-*Nathaniel Dray*
-*Jonathan Moyers*
-*Rachelle McCoy*
-*Jacob Whitcomb*
-*Jordan Massey*

This repository has all of the source code for the deployment of ReConnect as of July 24, 2020 6:40PM EST.
The deployment can be found at <https://test-database-29a32.web.app>

All subpages are navigable from the main website. The only notable redirects are /happy and /sad which take you to the respective versions of the Questionnaire page.

The Questionnaire page will not push data to the database unless the url is formatted properly. It needs the argument ?s=true or ?s=false.

All data updates in realtime, so feel free to have multiple windows open and send a form while looking at the employer homepage!

All code written by Jonathan Moyers and Jacob Whitcomb
